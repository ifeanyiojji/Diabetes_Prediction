## Diabetes_Prediction

Welcome to my project. This is a diabetes prediction model using the support vector machine algorithm for linear models.
The model will be trained on a dataset containing information such as glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI, among others 

# Dataset

- Triceps skinfold thickness
- Insulin level
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

# Requirements
